## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

### Backend Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    -   Create a file named `.env` inside the `backend/` directory.
    -   Add your Google Gemini API key to the file like this:
        ```
        GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
        ```

5.  **Run the server:**
    -   Navigate to the `backend` directory.
    -   Use Uvicorn to run the FastAPI application:
        ```bash
        cd backend
        uvicorn main:app --reload
        ```
    -   The server will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
